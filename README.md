# House Sales Analysis

## Project Summary
This repository contains the code and documentation for the House Sales Analysis project. The project aims to analyze house sales in a northwestern county using multiple linear regression modeling. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to stakeholders, such as a real estate agency, regarding home renovations and their impact on the estimated value of houses.

The project follows a structured data science approach, including data understanding, data preparation, data analysis, regression modeling, and data visualization. The analysis includes feature selection, transformation, and iterative model building to improve the predictive power and interpretability of the models.

## Project Steps
The project encompasses the following steps:

1. Business Understanding: Clearly define the business problem and the value of the project for stakeholders.
2. Data Understanding: Describe the data sources and properties, and explain why the data are suitable for the project.
3. Data Preparation: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant features, and address outliers.
4. Data Analysis: Perform descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.
5. Iterated Regression Models: Build multiple regression models, evaluate their performance, and justify the steps taken in each iteration.
6. Data Visualization: Incorporate data visualization throughout the project to enhance understanding and storytelling.
7. Summary and Recommendations: Summarize the project, discuss key findings, and provide recommendations for stakeholders.
